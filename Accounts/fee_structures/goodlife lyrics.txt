One shot cah me need it bad
Next shot for the week weh me had
Three shots make me bun out me job
When me look 'pon me check
Me feel like me get robbed
Fourth shot fi bring in party season
Fifth shot me take just for no reason
Sixth shot make me almost forget
'Bout the whole damn week me get a beatin'
Ay! Sometimes inna me life I just wanna - hey
Hold a vibes and burn the marijuana - hey
Right cha now
Me ready fi go turn it up
Gimme the rum with the chaser
Ay, I got some, trees
Me waan fi roll it up, but me forget fi buy paper
This night's going down in history
Nobody can come talk shit to me
'Cause all me need is some girls and weed
And a lil bit a liquor and me dogs weh close to me
It's the good life
Oh, oh, ay, oh oh, ay
It's the good life
Oh, oh, ay, oh oh, ay
End of the month come the rent, nuh pay, but fuck it
Tell the boss not coming in today, me ducking
Cah the party a shot and me nah leave
And me have a hot gyal, a swear she waan breed
Cah anywhere the good vibes deh me love it
Music a fi me life put nothin' above it
A my life fi live a so me waan dweet
Move to my own beat. and
Sometimes inna me life I just wanna - hey
Hold a vibes and burn the marijuana - hey
Right cha now
Me ready fi go turn it up
Gimme the rum with the chaser

Me waan fi roll it up, but me forget fi buy paper
This night's going down in history
Nobody can come talk shit to me
'Cause all me need is some girls and weed
And a lil bit a liquor and me dogs weh close to me
It's the good life
Oh, oh, ay, oh oh, ay
